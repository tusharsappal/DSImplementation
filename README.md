Implementation of General Purpose Algorithms in Java Programming Language

'Main' Class is the main class that calls all other classes 

       1) GeneralArrayOperations Class will have all general purpose array operations performed on arrays like 
            
               * Searching for an element using the binary search and Linear Search 
               * Insertion in the array
               * Deletion of an element from the array
            
       2) Sorting Operations on Array Elements
       
               * Bubble Sort (Arranging the Array Elements in ascending order)
               * Selection Sort (Arranging the Array Elements in ascending order)
               * Insertion Sort (Arranging the Array Elements in ascending order)
       
       3) Basic  Stack Operations implemented in Java
